"""Analytical and diagnostic test tools.

This directory contains diagnostic/analysis tools for investigating specific behaviors,
thresholds, and edge cases. These are NOT regular tests - they are tools for:

- Investigating threshold behavior (e2e summarization thresholds)
- Capturing baseline metrics for comparison
- Diagnosing specific issues
- Performance analysis

These tests are excluded from regular test runs and should be run explicitly when needed.
