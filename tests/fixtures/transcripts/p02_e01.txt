Ethan:
Welcome to Practical Systems. I’m Ethan Park. Today we’re talking about on-call—specifically, how to do it without burning people out. My guest is Priya Nair, an SRE who’s spent years designing on-call rotations that actually work. Priya, welcome.

Priya:
Thanks, Ethan. I’m glad we’re talking about this in human terms.

Ethan:
Let’s start simple. When on-call goes wrong, what does that usually look like?

Priya:
Too many alerts, unclear ownership, and no time to recover. People think the problem is that incidents happen, but the real issue is that engineers never get a break from them.

Ethan:
So the pager isn’t the problem—the system behind it is.

Priya:
Exactly. If your system pages for things no one needs to act on, you’re training people to ignore alerts. That’s dangerous and exhausting.

Ethan:
What’s the first thing you look at when you join a team with painful on-call?

Priya:
Alert volume. I ask, “How many pages per week?” If the answer is more than a handful, that’s a smell. Then we ask which alerts actually require a human to wake up.

Ethan:
How do you convince teams to delete alerts? People get nervous about that.

Priya:
We frame it as improving signal, not reducing safety. If an alert hasn’t led to action in months, it’s noise. Removing it makes the remaining alerts more meaningful.

Ethan:
What about error budgets? They’re often misunderstood.

Priya:
Yeah. Error budgets aren’t permission to be sloppy. They’re a way to balance reliability work with feature work. If you’re burning budget too fast, it’s a signal to slow down and fix things.

Ethan:
One thing I hear from engineers is fear—fear of being the one on call when something breaks.

Priya:
That’s usually a sign of poor documentation and unclear escalation paths. On-call should never feel like you’re alone in the dark at 3 a.m.

⸻

[07:55]

Ethan:
What’s one small improvement teams can make quickly?

Priya:
Write down “what good looks like” for alerts. What condition triggers a page, who responds, and what the first step is. Even that alone reduces stress.

[09:10]

Ethan:
Last question: how do you know when on-call is healthy?

Priya:
When people can go on vacation without dread. When incidents are learning moments, not trauma. That’s the goal.

Priya, thanks for sharing your experience.

Priya:
Thanks, Ethan.
