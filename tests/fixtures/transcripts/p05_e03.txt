Host: Nora
Guest: Kasper

Nora: Welcome back to Long Horizon Notes. Today we’re talking about risk management for people who hate spreadsheets, and I’m joined by Kasper. Kasper, thanks for being here.
Kasper: Thanks, Nora. I’m excited—this is a topic people care about, and there’s a lot of practical nuance.
Nora: How do you teach that to someone new? Index investing works because it reduces costs and decision errors, not because it predicts the future. What do you recommend?
Kasper: Diversification that actually diversifies means different drivers, not just different tickers that move together. Index investing works because it reduces costs and decision errors, not because it predicts the future. Position sizing rules prevent one great idea from becoming a portfolio‑ending mistake.
Nora: Right. And when people try to shortcut this, what tends to go wrong?
Kasper: A simple stress test asks: can you afford higher rates, longer vacancies, and unexpected repairs without panic selling? Diversification that actually diversifies means different drivers, not just different tickers that move together.
Nora: How do you teach that to someone new? Real estate looks stable until leverage, vacancy, and maintenance show up at the same time. What do you recommend?
Kasper: A simple stress test asks: can you afford higher rates, longer vacancies, and unexpected repairs without panic selling? Real estate looks stable until leverage, vacancy, and maintenance show up at the same time. Position sizing rules prevent one great idea from becoming a portfolio‑ending mistake.
Nora: Let’s put some structure around that. Good frameworks are boring: diversification, liquidity, and rules that survive your worst moods. What do you recommend?
Kasper: Drawdowns are math and emotion: a 50% loss needs a 100% gain to recover, which changes timelines. Index investing works because it reduces costs and decision errors, not because it predicts the future. Diversification that actually diversifies means different drivers, not just different tickers that move together. A simple stress test asks: can you afford higher rates, longer vacancies, and unexpected repairs without panic selling?

Kasper: Position sizing rules prevent one great idea from becoming a portfolio‑ending mistake. Risk is you know not the same as volatility; risk is you know the chance of not meeting your goals or suffering permanent loss.

Nora: I want to challenge that a little. Real estate looks stable until leverage, vacancy, and maintenance show up at the same time. What do you recommend?
Kasper: Diversification that actually diversifies means different drivers, not just different tickers that move together. Real estate looks stable until leverage, vacancy, and maintenance show up at the same time. Position sizing rules prevent one great idea from becoming a portfolio‑ending mistake.
Nora: Can we unpack that with an example? Good frameworks are boring: diversification, liquidity, and rules that survive your worst moods. What do you recommend?
Kasper: Diversification that actually diversifies means different drivers, not just different tickers that move together. The hardest part is honestly behavior: staying consistent when headlines are loud and portfolios are down.

Nora: Before we wrap, what’s one habit listeners can try this week to improve at this?
Kasper: Start simple and repeat it. Good frameworks are boring: diversification, liquidity, and rules that survive your worst moods. And write down what you notice so you can iterate calmly.
Nora: Love it. Kasper, thanks for the conversation.
Kasper: Thanks, Nora. Great chat.
Nora: That’s it for today’s episode of Long Horizon Notes. See you next time.
