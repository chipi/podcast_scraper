Nora:
Welcome back to Long Horizon Notes. Today’s episode is a longer conversation about risk—how to think about it without turning everything into a spreadsheet. My guest is Kasper Jansen, a risk management specialist. Kasper, welcome.

Kasper:
Thanks, Nora. I promise we’ll keep spreadsheets to a minimum.

⸻

[01:20]

Nora:
Let’s start broad. What do people misunderstand about risk?

Kasper:
They think risk is volatility. Volatility is visible, but risk is about the chance of permanent loss.

⸻

[02:45]

Nora:
So smooth returns aren’t necessarily safe.

Kasper:
Exactly. Some of the riskiest strategies look calm—until they don’t.

⸻

[04:10]

Nora:
How do you talk about risk with people who dislike numbers?

Kasper:
With scenarios. “What happens if X goes wrong?” Stories stick better than formulas.

⸻

[05:35]

Nora:
Diversification is often misunderstood.

Kasper:
True diversification means different failure modes. Owning many assets that fail together isn’t diversification.

⸻

[07:00]

Nora:
What about drawdowns? People underestimate them.

Kasper:
Yes. A 50% loss requires a 100% gain to recover. That math surprises people emotionally.

⸻

[08:30]

Nora:
How do you size positions without spreadsheets?

Kasper:
Rules. Maximum percentage per position, maximum exposure per idea. Simple limits beat complex models most of the time.

⸻

[10:05]

Nora:
What role does behavior play?

Kasper:
A huge one. Most risk comes from reacting badly under stress.

⸻

[12:00]

Nora:
Let’s pause briefly.
Short break.

⸻

[12:30]

Nora:
We’re back. Let’s talk about tail risks.

Kasper:
Tail risks are rare but severe. You don’t predict them—you prepare for them.

⸻

[14:00]

Nora:
How do people prepare without over-hedging?

Kasper:
By accepting uncertainty. Avoid leverage, keep liquidity, and don’t optimize for perfection.

⸻

[15:40]

Nora:
Any myths you’d like to debunk?

Kasper:
That risk can be eliminated. It can only be managed.

⸻

[17:05]

Nora:
What’s a sign of a resilient portfolio?

Kasper:
It survives bad years without forcing you to change plans.

⸻

[18:40]

Nora:
How should investors think about time?

Kasper:
Longer horizons forgive many mistakes—but only if you stay invested.

⸻

[20:10]

Nora:
Advice for listeners overwhelmed by risk discussions?

Kasper:
Start simple. Define rules you can follow when emotions run high.

⸻

[22:00]

Nora:
Last question: what’s your personal guiding principle?

Kasper:
Avoid ruin first. Everything else comes after.

⸻

[23:30]

Nora:
Kasper, thanks for the perspective.

Kasper:
Thanks, Nora.
