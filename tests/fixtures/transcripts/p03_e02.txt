Rina:
Welcome back to Below the Surface. Today we’re talking marine biology—not from a textbook, but from a diver’s perspective. My guest is marine biologist Hanna de Wit. Hanna, welcome.

Hanna:
Thanks, Rina. I love talking to divers.

Rina:
Divers love identifying species. What do they most often get wrong?

Hanna:
They focus on names instead of behavior. Understanding what an animal is doing tells you more than memorizing labels.

Rina:
Any common misconceptions?

Hanna:
That reefs are static. They’re dynamic systems—constantly changing with seasons, temperature, and human impact.

Rina:
How can divers be better observers?

Hanna:
Slow down. The less you move, the more life reveals itself. Patience is a skill underwater.

Rina:
Touching marine life—still a problem?

Hanna:
Unfortunately. Even gentle contact can damage delicate organisms or stress animals.

[06:10]

Rina:
Any tip divers can apply immediately?

Hanna:
Practice neutral buoyancy. Good buoyancy protects reefs more than any rule.

Rina:
What excites you about divers learning biology?

Hanna:
Divers become advocates. Seeing leads to caring.
