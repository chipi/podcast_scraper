Alex Morgan: Ethics, Limits, and the Next Decade of Human Optimization

Alex Morgan: In 2025, human optimization and its ethical limits is everywhere in public conversation, but the signal is often mixed with hype. In this episode, I’m going to build a grounded map: what’s real, what’s uncertain, and what you can do without turning your life into an optimization project.

Alex Morgan: Where the field is right now.

Alex Morgan: The second step is to separate interventions that improve fundamentals from interventions that just create the feeling of progress.

Alex Morgan: The most useful starting point is to ask what problem you’re trying to solve, and what constraints you can’t wish away: time, stress, sleep, money, and attention.

Alex Morgan: A good heuristic is to prefer boring things that compound: regular sleep timing, strength, protein, daylight, and social stability.

Alex Morgan: If a protocol only works when life is perfect, it is not a protocol; it is a performance.

Alex Morgan: If a protocol only works when life is perfect, it is not a protocol; it is a performance.

Alex Morgan: What the evidence is strongest on.

Alex Morgan: Finally, remember that biology is adaptive. The goal is resilience, not a permanent state of peak performance.

Alex Morgan: If a protocol only works when life is perfect, it is not a protocol; it is a performance.

Alex Morgan: What is mostly marketing.

Alex Morgan: When measurement helps, it should answer a question. When it becomes constant surveillance, it often increases anxiety and makes outcomes worse.
