Maya:
Welcome back to Singletrack Sessions. Today we’re cutting through the noise around enduro riding. My guest is coach Sophie van Dalen. Sophie, welcome.

Sophie:
Thanks, Maya. Happy to simplify things.

Maya:
Enduro content online can feel overwhelming. What should riders ignore?

Sophie:
Tricks that look impressive but don’t translate to consistency. Most riders improve faster by mastering basics like braking and body position.

Maya:
Let’s talk braking—still misunderstood?

Sophie:
Very. Riders either brake too much or not enough. Controlled braking before the turn is what gives you speed through it.

Maya:
What about suspension setup?

Sophie:
Close enough is usually good enough. People chase perfect settings instead of learning how their bike behaves on trail.

Maya:
Do you coach mindset as much as technique?

Sophie:
Absolutely. Confidence comes from predictability. If you know what your bike will do, you ride calmer and faster.

Maya:
Common training mistake?

Sophie:
Always riding at max effort. Skill sessions should be controlled. Fatigue hides bad habits.

Maya:
One drill riders can try this week?

Sophie:
Cornering repetitions on the same turn. Same line, same speed, multiple passes. It’s boring—and very effective.
