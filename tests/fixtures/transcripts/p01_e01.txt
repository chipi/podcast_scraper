Maya:
Welcome to Singletrack Sessions. I’m Maya Koster. Today we’re talking about trail building—not just how to make trails fun, but how to make them last. My guest is Liam Verbeek, a trail builder who’s worked on networks across Europe. Liam, welcome.

Liam:
Thanks, Maya. Happy to talk dirt.

Maya:
People often think trail building is just about digging, but there’s clearly more to it. What’s the biggest misconception?

Liam:
That trails fight nature. Good trails work with water, soil, and traffic. If you’re constantly repairing the same section, the design is probably wrong.

Maya:
Water always comes up first.

Liam:
Because water always wins. You can ignore riders for a while, but water will expose bad decisions immediately.

Maya:
What’s a common beginner mistake?

Liam:
Straight lines. New builders want direct paths, but contouring across a slope is almost always better for longevity and ride quality.

Maya:
How do you balance sustainability with fun?

Liam:
Flow doesn’t require erosion. Berms, grade reversals, and subtle rollers can be playful and durable if they’re shaped correctly.

Maya:
Do riders underestimate the work involved?

Liam:
Definitely. A trail that “feels natural” usually took a lot of deliberate effort to look that way.

Maya:
Any advice for riders who want to help?

Liam:
Volunteer, and listen. Local builders know the land. Showing up consistently matters more than raw strength.

Maya:
Last question: what makes a trail successful to you?

Liam:
When it rides well in all seasons and doesn’t need constant fixing. Silence from the maintenance crew is a good sign.

Maya:
Liam, thanks for the insight.

Liam:
Thanks, Maya.
