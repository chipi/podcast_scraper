Leo:
Welcome back to Frame & Light. Today we’re talking about documentary photography—specifically workflow when you’re on the move. My guest is Tariq Hassan, a documentary photographer who works across long-form projects. Tariq, welcome.

Tariq:
Thanks, Leo. Great to be here.

Leo:
Documentary work is often romanticized. What’s the reality?

Tariq:
It’s logistics. Batteries, backups, metadata, and making sure nothing gets lost when you’re tired.

Leo:
Let’s start with data. What’s non-negotiable?

Tariq:
Redundancy. Two backups minimum, ideally three. And verify before you format cards.

Leo:
How do you stay organized in the field?

Tariq:
Consistent naming and daily routines. Chaos creeps in when routines slip.

Leo:
Captions are often an afterthought.

Tariq:
They shouldn’t be. Context turns images into stories. I write notes the same day while details are fresh.

Leo:
Any common mistake you see?

Tariq:
Overshooting. Editing becomes harder, and important moments get buried.

Leo:
How do you balance presence with documentation?

Tariq:
Trust. When subjects trust you, you can work quietly and honestly.

Leo:
One habit listeners could adopt?

Tariq:
End each day by reviewing and labeling your work. It saves weeks later.

Tariq, thanks for the insight.

Tariq:
Thanks, Leo.
