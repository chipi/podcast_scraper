Maya: Welcome back to Singletrack Sessions. Today we're talking about building trails that last, and I'm joined by Liam. Liam, thanks for being here.
Liam: Thanks, Maya. I'm excited—this is a topic people care about, and there's a lot of practical nuance.
Maya: Let's put some structure around that. A lot of speed comes from braking earlier and smoother, not from taking bigger risks. What do you recommend?
Liam: On a berm, you want your eyes through the exit, hips centered, and pressure building gradually rather than spiking. Tire pressure and casing choice often matter more than a minor suspension tweak. When a trail drains well, it stays rideable longer, and the soil structure stays intact instead of turning to ruts.
Maya: Let's zoom out for a second. The bike should feel quiet and predictable so your attention stays on the trail, not on noises or surprises. What do you recommend?

A good maintenance routine is short and boring: check bolts, measure chain wear, clean stanchions, and inspect pads.
