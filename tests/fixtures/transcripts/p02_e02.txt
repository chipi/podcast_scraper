Ethan:
Welcome back to Practical Systems. Today we’re talking about communication at the staff engineer level—how decisions get made, documented, and shared. My guest is Jonas Meijer. Jonas, welcome.

Jonas:
Thanks, Ethan. Happy to be here.

Ethan:
When people think about staff engineers, they often focus on technical depth. But communication seems to matter just as much.

Jonas:
It does. At that level, your impact comes less from writing code and more from aligning people around good decisions.

Ethan:
Let’s talk about RFCs. Everyone has opinions about them.

Jonas:
Yeah. A good RFC isn’t about being right. It’s about making tradeoffs visible. If people understand why a decision was made, they’re more likely to support it—even if they disagree.

Ethan:
What’s a common mistake you see in design documents?

Jonas:
Overconfidence. Documents that pretend there are no downsides. That erodes trust quickly. I prefer explicitly listing risks and open questions.

Ethan:
How do you avoid turning everything into meetings?

Jonas:
Write first. Async discussion scales better and gives quieter people space to think. Meetings should be for resolving disagreements, not discovering them.

Ethan:
There’s also the challenge of influencing without authority.

Jonas:
Right. You can’t mandate. You persuade. That means understanding other teams’ constraints and framing proposals in terms of shared goals.

Ethan:
What about review fatigue? People get tired of reading long docs.

Jonas:
That’s on the author. Lead with the summary. Make it skimmable. Respect people’s time, and they’ll engage more deeply when it matters.

Ethan:
Any habit that helped you personally?

Jonas:
I end most documents with “What I need from you.” A decision, feedback, or just awareness. Clarity reduces friction.

Ethan:
That’s a great tip. Jonas, thanks for the conversation.

Jonas:
Thanks, Ethan.
