Rina:
Welcome back to Below the Surface. Today’s episode is a longer conversation about staying calm underwater. My guest is Owen Chen, a dive instructor who specializes in stress management and rescue skills. Owen, welcome.

Owen:
Thanks, Rina. This is one of my favorite topics.

⸻

[01:20]

Rina:
Divers talk a lot about technique, but less about mindset. Why does calm matter so much?

Owen:
Because stress consumes attention and gas. Calm buys you time, and time buys you options.

⸻

[02:45]

Rina:
What typically triggers panic?

Owen:
Surprise plus lack of rehearsal. Something unexpected happens and the diver hasn’t mentally practiced responding.

⸻

[04:10]

Rina:
How do you train calm?

Owen:
By introducing small problems in controlled settings. Mask removal, gas sharing, navigation drills—done slowly and repeatedly.

⸻

[05:35]

Rina:
Let’s talk buoyancy under stress.

Owen:
Buoyancy is often the first thing to go. People forget to breathe properly, which creates a feedback loop.

⸻

[07:00]

Rina:
Breathing sounds basic, but it’s clearly central.

Owen:
It is. Long, controlled exhales signal safety to your nervous system.

⸻

[08:30]

Rina:
Navigation issues seem common.

Owen:
Yes. Poor navigation increases stress late in a dive when gas is lower. Simple habits—checking headings, noting landmarks—reduce surprises.

⸻

[10:05]

Rina:
What about equipment problems?

Owen:
Most issues are minor. A free-flowing regulator is noisy, but manageable if you’ve practiced.

⸻

[12:00]

Rina:
Do you see differences between training environments and real dives?

Owen:
Absolutely. Real dives add cold, current, task loading. That’s why mental rehearsal matters.

⸻

[13:40]

Rina:
Let’s pause briefly.
Short break.

⸻

[14:10]

Rina:
We’re back. Let’s talk rescue scenarios. What’s the biggest mistake rescuers make?

Owen:
Rushing. Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.

⸻

[15:40]

Rina:
How do you assess a stressed diver?

Owen:
Look at eyes and breathing. Wide eyes and rapid breathing tell you a lot.

⸻

[17:05]

Rina:
What role does teamwork play?

Owen:
Huge. Clear hand signals and agreed-upon procedures reduce ambiguity.

⸻

[18:40]

Rina:
Any myths you want to dispel?

Owen:
That calm divers never feel fear. They do—they just manage it.

⸻

[20:10]

Rina:
How can divers practice outside the water?

Owen:
Visualization. Walk through dives mentally, including what could go wrong.

⸻

[22:00]

Rina:
What’s the sign of a mature diver?

Owen:
They call dives early without ego. That’s real confidence.

⸻

[23:30]

Rina:
Last advice for listeners?

Owen:
Skill plus calm equals safety. Invest in both.

⸻

[24:50]

Rina:
Owen, thank you for the depth today.

Owen:
Thanks, Rina.
