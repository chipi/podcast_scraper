Maya: Welcome back to Singletrack Sessions. Today we're talking about the mechanics of a quiet, fast bike, and I'm joined by Noah. Noah, thanks for being here.
Noah: Thanks, Maya. I'm excited—this is a topic people care about, and there's a lot of practical nuance.
Maya: I want to challenge that a little. The bike should feel quiet and predictable so your attention stays on the trail, not on noises or surprises.

Maya: That's it for today's episode of Singletrack Sessions. See you next time.
