Nora:
Welcome to Long Horizon Notes. I’m Nora Bakker. Today we’re talking about index investing—what it does well, what it doesn’t, and where people still get confused. My guest is Daniel Cho, who’s spent years teaching evidence-based investing. Daniel, welcome.

Daniel:
Thanks, Nora. Happy to cut through some myths.

Nora:
Let’s start with the biggest misconception.

Daniel:
That index investing is passive in the sense of “set it and forget it forever.” It’s rules-based, not thoughtless. You still make decisions about risk, time horizon, and behavior.

Nora:
People often compare indexing to stock picking emotionally.

Daniel:
Yes. Indexing feels boring, and boring doesn’t sell. But boredom is often a feature, not a bug.

Nora:
What about diversification? People say “I own an index, I’m diversified.”

Daniel:
Not always. You need to know which index and what it represents. Geographic and sector concentration still matter.

Nora:
Fees come up a lot.

Daniel:
Because they’re one of the few things investors can control. Small fee differences compound over decades.

Nora:
When does indexing not fit?

Daniel:
If your horizon is very short, or you need liquidity at a specific time. Indexing assumes patience.

Nora:
One habit listeners could adopt?

Daniel:
Automate contributions. Automation removes emotion from the process.

Nora:
Daniel, thanks for the clarity.

Daniel:
Thanks, Nora.
