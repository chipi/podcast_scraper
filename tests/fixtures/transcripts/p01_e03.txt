Maya:
Welcome back to Singletrack Sessions. Today we’re in the workshop. My guest is Noah Prins, a bike mechanic who’s diagnosed more mysterious clicks than anyone should have to. Noah, welcome.

Noah:
Thanks, Maya. Happy to talk about the sounds bikes make when they want attention.

⸻

[01:20]

Maya:
Let’s start there. Riders hear a noise and immediately panic. What’s usually going on?

Noah:
Most noises are harmless, but they’re clues. The trick is figuring out when the noise happens—pedaling, coasting, climbing, braking.

⸻

[02:45]

Maya:
What’s the most misdiagnosed sound?

Noah:
Bottom bracket creaks. Half the time it’s actually the seatpost or rear axle. Sound travels through frames in weird ways.

⸻

[04:10]

Maya:
Suspension setup scares people. Should it?

Noah:
Not really. Start with sag. If sag is wrong, nothing else matters. Damping tweaks only make sense once sag is correct.

⸻

[05:35]

Maya:
How often should riders service suspension?

Noah:
Lower leg service every 50 hours is a good baseline. People wait too long, then wonder why performance drops.

⸻

[07:00]

Maya:
Drivetrain wear is another big topic.

Noah:
Yeah, and it’s cheaper to replace parts early. A worn chain destroys cassettes and chainrings. Measuring wear saves money.

⸻

[08:30]

Maya:
Let’s talk brakes. What do riders get wrong?

Noah:
They chase power instead of control. Proper bleed, clean rotors, and good pads matter more than brand upgrades.

⸻

[10:05]

Maya:
Clicks that only happen uphill—what’s your checklist?

Noah:
Pedals, chainring bolts, cassette lockring, rear axle. In that order. Ninety percent of the time it’s one of those.

⸻

[12:00]

Maya:
Do you see differences between home mechanics and shop mechanics?

Noah:
Home mechanics often rush reassembly. Torque matters. Clean threads matter. Grease matters.

⸻

[13:40]

Maya:
What about modern internal cable routing?

Noah:
Great for looks, bad for noise. Foam sleeves help, but some frames will always have a bit of rattle.

⸻

[15:10]

Maya:
Let’s pause briefly.
Short break.

⸻

[15:40]

Maya:
We’re back. Let’s talk about preventative maintenance. What’s the biggest win?

Noah:
Cleaning. Dirt accelerates wear everywhere. A quick wipe-down after wet rides saves hours later.

⸻

[17:05]

Maya:
How do tires factor into a “fast” bike?

Noah:
Pressure and compound. Too much pressure kills grip; too little kills casing support. Tire choice matters more than people think.

⸻

[18:40]

Maya:
What about torque specs—are people too obsessed?

Noah:
They’re often ignored, actually. Torque wrenches aren’t about precision—they’re about consistency.

⸻

[20:10]

Maya:
Any myths you’d like to kill?

Noah:
That lighter is always faster. A quiet, reliable bike lets you focus on riding instead of worrying.

⸻

[22:00]

Maya:
What’s your approach when diagnosing a stubborn issue?

Noah:
Change one thing at a time. Systematic work beats guessing every time.

⸻

[23:30]

Maya:
If a rider wants to learn basic maintenance, where should they start?

Noah:
Brake pads, chain wear, bolt checks. Master those, then expand.

⸻

[25:00]

Maya:
Last question: what does a “well-set-up” bike feel like?

Noah:
Quiet. Predictable. Nothing distracts you from the trail.

⸻

[26:20]

Maya:
Noah, thanks for the deep dive.

Noah:
Thanks, Maya.
