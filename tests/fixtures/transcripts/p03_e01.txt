Rina:
Welcome to Below the Surface. I’m Rina Okafor. Today we’re talking about wreck diving—how to approach it safely and thoughtfully. My guest is Marco Silva, an experienced wreck diver and instructor. Marco, welcome.

Marco:
Thanks, Rina. Happy to talk about rust and rope.

Rina:
Wrecks attract a lot of divers. What do you think draws people in?

Marco:
They’re time capsules. You’re not just seeing structure—you’re seeing history frozen underwater.

Rina:
What’s the biggest mistake newer wreck divers make?

Marco:
Overconfidence. They underestimate how quickly conditions can change—silt, current, visibility—and how disorienting enclosed spaces can be.

Rina:
Let’s talk planning. What’s non-negotiable?

Marco:
A clear plan for penetration—or a clear decision not to penetrate. Line use, gas planning, and exit strategy should all be decided before you splash.

Rina:
Gas planning is often glossed over.

Marco:
Yeah. Rule of thirds exists for a reason. And that’s assuming nothing goes wrong.

Rina:
Lighting?

Marco:
Primary plus backup. Darkness amplifies stress. Redundancy buys calm.

Rina:
Any advice for divers curious about wrecks but not trained yet?

Marco:
Stay outside, take a course, and respect limits. Wrecks aren’t going anywhere.

Rina:
Marco, thanks for grounding the excitement with reality.

Marco:
Anytime.
