Leo:
Welcome to Frame & Light. I’m Leo Hartman. Today we’re talking underwater photography—specifically how to make images that feel alive rather than flat. My guest is Ava Lemoine, an underwater photographer with a background in marine science. Ava, welcome.

Ava:
Thanks, Leo. Happy to be here.

Leo:
Underwater photos often look blue and lifeless. Why does that happen?

Ava:
Water absorbs light quickly, especially reds. Without intentional lighting or white balance, the scene loses depth and contrast.

Leo:
What’s the first thing photographers should focus on improving?

Ava:
Strobe positioning. Moving strobes away from the lens axis reduces backscatter and brings out texture.

Leo:
How much does subject behavior matter?

Ava:
A lot. Understanding animal behavior helps you anticipate moments instead of chasing them.

Leo:
Composition underwater—same rules as topside?

Ava:
Same principles, different constraints. You often compose with your fins as much as your camera.

Leo:
Any quick tip for divers starting out?

Ava:
Slow down. The calmer you are, the calmer the scene becomes.

Leo:
Favorite beginner mistake?

Ava:
Shooting everything. Fewer, more intentional frames usually lead to better images.
