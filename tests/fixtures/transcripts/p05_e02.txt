Nora:
Welcome back to Long Horizon Notes. Today we’re talking real estate investing—and why stories can be dangerous if they replace math. My guest is Isabel Martins, a real estate analyst and investor. Isabel, welcome.

Isabel:
Thanks, Nora. Happy to talk numbers.

Nora:
Real estate is often sold as “safe.” Is it?

Isabel:
It’s tangible, which feels safe. But leverage, vacancy, and maintenance introduce real risk.

Nora:
What’s the first number you look at?

Isabel:
Cash flow after all expenses. Not projected, not optimistic—actual.

Nora:
Maintenance surprises people.

Isabel:
Yes. Roofs, plumbing, vacancies—they don’t arrive politely on schedule.

Nora:
How do narratives mislead?

Isabel:
“Up-and-coming area” often means assumptions without data. Numbers keep you grounded.

Nora:
What about leverage?

Isabel:
Leverage amplifies outcomes. It’s helpful when things go well, unforgiving when they don’t.

Nora:
One practical rule of thumb?

Isabel:
Stress-test for higher interest rates and longer vacancies than you expect.

Thanks, Nora.
