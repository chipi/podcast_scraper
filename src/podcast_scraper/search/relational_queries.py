"""Relational query layer over the cross-layer CorpusGraph (RFC-094, #882).

Read-only queries that traverse the **typed** meaning-bearing edges (#874) to answer
the surface questions PRD-033 needs:

- `positions_of(person)` — the insights a person *stated* (Person Landing, FR4.1).
- `who_said(topic)` — per-person insights on a topic (Topic Entity View, FR4.2).
- `insights_about(entity)` — insights that *mention* a person/org (entity grounding).
- `entities_in(insight)` — the people/orgs an insight mentions.
- `episodes_of(show)` — a show's episodes (show navigation, FR3.3 / FR2.3).
- `cross_show_synthesis(topic)` — the top insight per distinct show covering a topic
  (the corpus differentiator, FR3.2 / FR4.2).
- `related_insights(insight)` — sibling insights sharing a topic or mentioned entity
  (Detail panel "related", Graph neighbourhood; FR4.3 / FR5).

These rely on **edge types** (via ``CorpusGraph.typed_neighbors``): a person↔insight
pair can be ``STATES`` (the person stated it) or ``MENTIONS`` (the insight mentions the
person), and the queries must not conflate them. Structure comes from the graph; these
are intentionally read-only and never raise (empty result on a missing/unknown id).
Supporting-evidence ranking via hybrid (RFC-090) is layered at the call site.

The functions accept any object exposing ``get_node(id) -> Node | None`` and
``typed_neighbors(id, edge_type) -> list[str]`` (i.e. ``CorpusGraph``). For
``positions_of`` / ``who_said`` the graph must be built with
``derive_speaker_links=True`` (which synthesizes the ``STATES`` edges).
