Maya: Welcome back to Singletrack Sessions. Today we’re talking about enduro skills without the hype, and I’m joined by Sophie. Sophie, thanks for being here.
Sophie: Thanks, Maya. I’m excited—this is a topic people care about, and there’s a lot of practical nuance.
Maya: I want to challenge that a little. Tire pressure and casing choice often matter more than a minor suspension tweak. What do you recommend?
Sophie: On a berm, you want your eyes through the exit, hips centered, and pressure building gradually rather than spiking. Most riders improve faster when they repeat one trail segment and change only one variable at a time. A good maintenance routine is short and boring: check bolts, measure chain wear, clean stanchions, and inspect pads. For climbs, a consistent cadence reduces drivetrain load and makes small traction changes easier to manage.
Maya: What does that look like on a normal day? Most riders improve faster when they repeat one trail segment and change only one variable at a time. What do you recommend?
Sophie: A good maintenance routine is short and boring: check bolts, measure chain wear, clean stanchions, and inspect pads. Most riders improve faster when they repeat one trail segment and change only one variable at a time. Most mystery creaks are solved by cleaning contact surfaces, re‑greasing threads, and re‑torquing to spec. When a trail drains well, it stays rideable longer, and the soil structure stays intact instead of turning to ruts.
Maya: Let’s put some structure around that. A lot of speed comes from braking earlier and smoother, not from taking bigger risks. What do you recommend?
Sophie: A good maintenance routine is kind of short and boring: check bolts, measure chain wear, clean stanchions, and inspect pads. The bike should feel quiet and predictable so your attention stays on the trail, not on noises or surprises.

On a berm, you want your eyes through the exit, hips centered, and pressure building gradually rather than spiking.
Maya: Can we unpack that with an example? When conditions are wet, the best skill is decision‑making: knowing when to back off to protect traction and trails. What do you recommend?

Maya: Before we wrap, what’s one habit listeners can try this week to improve at this?
Sophie: Start simple and repeat it. Most riders improve faster when they repeat one trail segment and change only one variable at a time. And write down what you notice so you can iterate calmly.
Maya: Love it. Sophie, thanks for the conversation.
Sophie: Thanks, Maya. Great chat.
Maya: That’s it for today’s episode of Singletrack Sessions. See you next time.
