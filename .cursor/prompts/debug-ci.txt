Analyze this CI failure step by step.

Context:
- Python project
- CI via GitHub Actions
- Docker may be involved
- Recent changes are relevant

Tasks:
1. Summarize what failed (job, step, error)
2. List 2–3 plausible root causes, ranked by likelihood
3. For each cause, explain how to confirm or rule it out
4. Recommend the safest fix with minimal side effects
5. Call out any hidden risks or follow-up checks

Rules:
- Do NOT jump to code changes immediately
- Prefer deterministic, reproducible explanations
- Be explicit about assumptions

Use when: CI fails, logs are long, cause unclear
Effect: Auto almost always upgrades to a reasoning-heavy model
