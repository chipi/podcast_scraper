# Git Worktree - Quick Reference

**For complete guide:** `docs/guides/GIT_WORKTREE_GUIDE.md` (478 lines)

## 🚀 Quick Start

**For manual worktree setup (no make wt-setup):** Use the **git-worktree-setup** skill. This project prefers `make wt-setup` when available.

### Create New Worktree (Full Setup)

```bash
# One command to set up everything
make wt-setup

# Follow prompts:
# - Issue number (optional): 169
# - Branch type: feat
# - Short name: dependabot

# Then navigate and open
cd ../podcast_scraper-169-dependabot
source .venv/bin/activate
cursor .
```

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Make changes and commit
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(#169): add Dependabot configuration"

# Push to feature branch
git push origin HEAD

# Sync with main when needed
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
git push --force-with-lease  # NEVER use --force
```

### Cleanup After PR Merge

```bash
# Remove worktree
make wt-remove

# Follow prompts to remove worktree and optionally delete branch
```

## 📋 Branch Naming Convention

Include GitHub issue numbers for traceability:

| Pattern | Example | Use Case |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `feat/{issue}-{name}` | `feat/169-dependabot` | Feature linked to issue |
| `fix/{issue}-{name}` | `fix/185-memory-leak` | Bug fix linked to issue |
| `rel/{version}` | `rel/2.5` | Release preparation |
| `feat/{name}` | `feat/experimental` | No issue (exploratory) |

**Benefits:**
- `git worktree list` shows which issue each worktree addresses
- GitHub auto-links commits/PRs to issues
- Easy to find related issue from any git log

## 🔧 Makefile Commands

```bash
make wt-setup     # Interactive setup (creates worktree + venv)
make wt-list      # List all worktrees with status
make wt-remove    # Interactive removal
make wt-prune     # Prune stale worktree references
```

## ⚙️ Manual Setup (If Needed)

**For the procedure:** Use the **git-worktree-setup** skill.

**This project:** Worktree path pattern `../podcast_scraper-<issue>-<name>`; venv `.venv`; install `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### One Branch = One Worktree = One Cursor Window

Each branch gets:
- Its own folder (e.g., `../podcast_scraper-169-dependabot`)
- Its own virtual environment (isolated dependencies)
- Its own terminal session
- Its own Cursor instance

This ensures:
- Clean Git state per context
- Correct AI context for each task
- Zero accidental cross-contamination
- Independent Python environments

## 🔄 Rebase Strategy

### When to Rebase

✅ Rebase when:
- PR is ready for review (clean diff)
- CI failing due to main changes (get latest fixes)
- Merge conflicts expected (smaller conflicts)
- Main has breaking changes you need

❌ Don't rebase when:
- Just want latest changes for curiosity
- Actively coding with no blockers

### Rebase Commands

```bash
# Standard rebase
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# If conflicts occur
git status  # See conflicting files
# ... resolve conflicts ...
git add <resolved-files>
git rebase --continue

# If rebase goes wrong
git rebase --abort  # Return to pre-rebase state

# Push rebased branch
git push --force-with-lease  # NEVER use --force
```

## 🚨 Workflow Rules

### MUST (Required)

- ✅ **Never commit directly to main** - All changes via PR
- ✅ **One branch per worktree** - Don't switch branches inside worktrees
- ✅ **Use `--force-with-lease` after rebase** - Never use `--force`
- ✅ **Remove worktree after PR merge** - Prevents clutter
- ✅ **All PRs use squash merge** - Maintains linear history

### SHOULD (Recommended)

- ✅ **Rebase before requesting review** - Clean diff for reviewers
- ✅ **Include issue number in branch name** - Traceability
- ✅ **Use isolated venv per worktree** - Complete isolation
- ✅ **Run `make wt-list` weekly** - Audit for forgotten worktrees
- ✅ **Open separate Cursor window per worktree** - Clean AI context

## 🆘 Emergency Recovery

**For the procedure:** Use the **git-worktree-recovery** skill.

**This project:** Worktree paths `../podcast_scraper-*`; venv reinstall `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.

## 📊 Disk Space

Per worktree:
- Working files: ~50MB
- Virtual environment: ~150MB
- Shared Git objects: 0 (reused)
- **Total: ~200MB per worktree**

With 5 active worktrees: ~1GB total

## ✅ Weekly Maintenance Checklist

```bash
# Check for forgotten worktrees
make wt-list

# Remove worktrees for merged PRs
make wt-remove

# Clean stale references
make wt-prune

# Check disk usage
du -sh ../podcast_scraper-*

# Update main
cd podcast_scraper && git pull
```

## 🔗 GitHub Issue Auto-Close

Use these keywords in PR title or description to auto-close issues:

| Keyword | Example | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `Fixes` | `Fixes #169` | Closes issue #169 |
| `Closes` | `Closes #169` | Closes issue #169 |
| `Resolves` | `Resolves #169` | Closes issue #169 |

**Tip:** Include in PR title for visibility: `feat: Add Dependabot (Fixes #169)`

## 📖 Visual Workflow

```text
Create Worktree → Develop + Test → Push Branch → Fast CI
                                                     ↓
                                              Open PR to main
                                                     ↓
                                              Full CI (~10 min)
                                                     ↓
                                              Merge (squash)
                                                     ↓
                                              Remove Worktree
```

## Remember

1. **One worktree per feature** - Parallel development
2. **Isolated venvs** - No dependency conflicts
3. **Include issue numbers** - Traceability
4. **Rebase before review** - Clean diffs
5. **Remove after merge** - Keep workspace clean
6. **Weekly audit** - `make wt-list` to check for forgotten worktrees
