# AI Coding Guidelines - Primary Reference

## MANDATORY: Read .ai-coding-guidelines.md First

**Before taking ANY action, you MUST:**
1. Read `.ai-coding-guidelines.md` - This is the PRIMARY source of truth
2. Follow ALL CRITICAL rules marked in that file
3. Reference it for all decisions about code, workflow, and patterns

## Critical Workflow Rules (from .ai-coding-guidelines.md)

**NEVER commit without:**
- Showing user what files changed (`git status`)
- Showing user the actual changes (`git diff`)
- Getting explicit user approval
- User deciding commit message

**NEVER push to PR without:**
- Running `make ci` locally first
- Ensuring `make ci` passes completely
- Fixing all failures before pushing

## Primary Reference

**All guidelines, patterns, and rules are in `.ai-coding-guidelines.md`**
**Read it at the start of every session and reference it constantly.**
