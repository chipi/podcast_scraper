# Doc-freshness audit + reconciliation programme (2026-07-07)

Operator-requested thorough review of **all** docs — architecture, tests, RFC, PRD, ADR,
guides — to make them match shipped code. 537 markdown files under `docs/`. This is the
tracking ledger; it is itself WIP (point-in-time) and gets removed when the sweep closes.

## Treatment by category (decision-record integrity preserved)

| Category | Count | Treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `guides/` (core) | ~20 | **Rewrite current** — they describe the live system. |
| `architecture/`, `api/` | ~26 | **Rewrite current** — same. |
| `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` | 2 | **Rewrite current.** |
| `rfc/` | 103 | **Status-correct + body amendments** (dated design records — no history erasure). |
| `prd/` | 45 | **Status-correct + body amendments** where product behavior changed. |
| `adr/` | 107 | **Status-correct + add "Superseded by" pointers only.** Never rewrite; code-divergent decisions get a NEW superseding ADR. |
| `guides/eval-reports/`, `guides/performance-reports/` | 50 | **Leave** — point-in-time measurement records. |
| `wip/`, `releases/`, `incidents/` | ~78 | **Leave** — point-in-time; at most mark superseded. |

## The recent code changes docs may not reflect (the divergence checklist)

- Consumer app moved `app/` → `web/learning-player/` (slice 14 on main).
- transformers upgraded to **v5** + ML-architecture unification (`providers/ml/*` rewritten).
- Enrichment **accuracy gate** (`eval/admission` → `profile_sets._admit`) gates enrichers by
  measured precision. `nli_contradiction` (0%, #1106) + `stance_disagreement` (0%, #1144) are
  **gated dark** (never run). The live disagreement/multi-speaker surface is `perspectives`
  (#1146), which is a CIL query, not an enricher.
- Real enricher set = 9: 6 deterministic (grounding_rate, guest_coappearance, insight_density,
  temporal_velocity, topic_cooccurrence_corpus, **topic_theme_clusters**), `topic_similarity`
  (embedding), `nli_contradiction` + `stance_disagreement` (ML, gated). There is **no**
  episode-scope `topic_cooccurrence` enricher (older docs claim one).
- Enrichment invoked as `python -m podcast_scraper.cli enrich` (peer of the pipeline).
- The `ingest` primitive was built then **dropped** — the single-feed pipeline *is* ingestion.
- Jobs registry spawns each job's **own** stored command (`argv_from_record`), not always the pipeline.

## Method

1. Parallel audit fan-out (5 read-only agents, one per category) → per-doc staleness findings.
2. Synthesize findings into the progress table below.
3. Fix in waves; reference docs first (highest value), then RFC/PRD bodies, then ADR status/supersession.
4. `make docs` (mkdocs strict) after each wave; commit per wave.

## Audit result (5 parallel auditors, 2026-07-07)

**Headline: the corpus is well-maintained** — most reference docs were reconciled in prior
sessions, and the RFC audit found **zero silent body divergences**. Findings are mostly status
fields, a couple of stale paths, one filename collision, and a few decisions that lack an ADR.

### Fixed this wave

| Doc | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `guides/ENRICHMENT_LAYER_GUIDE.md` | Real 9-enricher table (dropped non-existent episode `topic_cooccurrence`, added `topic_theme_clusters` + `stance_disagreement`); new accuracy-gate section; per-enricher reference for the two new ones; profile matrix reframed as gate-filtered candidates; `topic_similarity` validation + top_k=7. |
| `guides/testing-strategy-ml.md` | transformers `>=4.40` → `>=5.0.0`. |
| `api/index.md` | Server-Guide row said `web/learning-player/` route arch → `web/gi-kg-viewer/`. |
| `web/learning-player/README.md` | `cd app` → `cd web/learning-player`. |
| `adr/ADR-060`, `adr/ADR-061` | Status `Accepted` → `Superseded by ADR-099` (pointer already present; field lagged). |
| `adr/ADR-077` | Malformed `**Status:**` → list-form `- **Status**:`. |
| `rfc/RFC-096` | Status `Draft` → `Completed` (audio pipeline separation shipped). |
| `rfc/RFC-098`, `rfc/RFC-099`, `rfc/RFC-100` | Status `Draft` → `In Progress` (consumer platform shipped in phases). |
| `prd/PRD-041` | Goals listed "contradictions" as a delivered signal — amended (gated dark; perspectives is the live surface). |
| `prd/PRD-037` | FR1.3a related-topics-in-search amended (shipped on entity cards, not Discovery search). |

### Verified-and-left-alone (agent suggested, I checked, no change needed)

- **ADR-067** — agent thought ADR-068 supersedes it. It doesn't: ADR-068 references it ("see ADR-067")
  but supersedes the prior *authority*, not ADR-067's Pegasus-retirement decision. Left as Accepted.
- **PRD-026** status "Implemented" is accurate (operator Topic Entity View). Minor consumer/operator
  wording nuance only.
- **RFC-082 / RFC-089** use a `> **Status:**` blockquote vs the list form — cosmetic, left.

### Resolved (operator approved both, 2026-07-07)

1. **ADR-099 collision — FIXED.** The guardrails file renumbered `ADR-099` → **ADR-105** (`git mv`),
   12 files' references updated (filename links + bare mentions + a `TESTING_STRATEGY` anchor), the
   LanceDB `ADR-099` left untouched. ADR-060/061 index Superseded count reconciled. `make docs` passes.
2. **Three new ADRs written** for shipped-but-undocumented decisions:
   [ADR-106](../adr/ADR-106-transformers-v5-ml-backend-unification.md) (transformers v5 + backend
   unification, #382 — retroactive capture grounded in code),
   [ADR-107](../adr/ADR-107-ingestion-is-the-pipeline-drop-ingest-primitive.md) (ingest primitive
   dropped, #1069), [ADR-108](../adr/ADR-108-nli-disagreement-enrichers-gated-dark.md) (NLI/stance
   enrichers gated dark, #1106/#1144). Added to `adr/index.md`.
