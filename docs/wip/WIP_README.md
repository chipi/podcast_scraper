# Work In Progress (WIP) Documentation

This folder contains temporary documentation, ideas, references, and work-in-progress notes that
are not yet finalized or integrated into the main documentation.

## Purpose

- **Temporary Ideas**: Early-stage concepts and brainstorming
- **Architecture Assessments**: Modularity evaluations and refactoring opportunities
- **Quick References**: Temporary reference materials
- **Draft Documents**: Documents being developed but not yet ready for main docs

## Current Contents

| File | Description | Status |
| ------ | ------------- | -------- |
| `BRANCH_CREATION_CHECKLIST.md` | Checklist for creating new branches | Active |
| `METRICS_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` | Gap analysis for metrics implementation | Active |

## Guidelines

- Documents here are **not** part of the official documentation
- They may be incomplete, outdated, or experimental
- When ready, documents should be moved to appropriate locations:
  - Architecture docs → `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` or new architecture docs
  - RFCs → `docs/rfc/`
  - PRDs → `docs/prd/`
  - Release notes → `docs/releases/`
- Feel free to add new WIP documents here as needed

## Cleanup

Periodically review and either:

1. Move finalized documents to their proper location
2. Delete outdated or obsolete documents
3. Archive important historical documents
