# Work In Progress (WIP) Documentation

This folder holds early-stage notes, backlog plans, and reference material that has
not been promoted to a PRD, RFC, ADR, runbook, or release note. Content here is
**not authoritative** — when an item is ready, it moves to its proper home and the
WIP file is removed.

## Promotion targets

- Long-term feature ideas → **PRD** in `docs/prd/` and the relevant **RFC** in `docs/rfc/`
- Architectural decisions → **ADR** in `docs/adr/`
- Operator-facing procedures → **guide** in `docs/guides/`
- Post-release retrospective → reference from the corresponding release note in `docs/releases/`

## Guidelines

- Documents here are **not** part of the official documentation site.
- Documents may be incomplete, outdated, or experimental.
- Periodically review and either:
  1. Promote to the appropriate doc category (PRD / RFC / ADR / guide / release note).
  2. Delete if obsolete or superseded.
  3. Keep as backlog / reference if it still has signal.

## Recent cleanups

- **2026-05-22** — Removed `GRAPH_NAVIGATION_HANDOFF_ANALYSIS.md`; superseded by
  shipped graph handoff orchestrator ([ADR-094](../adr/ADR-094-graph-handoff-orchestrator-fsm.md),
  [RFC-085](../rfc/RFC-085-graph-handoff-orchestrator-retrospective.md)).
