# Requests for Comment (RFCs)

## Purpose

Requests for Comment (RFCs) define the **how** behind each feature implementation in `podcast_scraper`. They capture:

- **Technical design** and architecture decisions
- **Implementation details** and module boundaries
- **API contracts** and data structures
- **Testing strategies** and validation approaches

RFCs translate PRD requirements into concrete technical solutions and serve as living documentation for developers.

## How RFCs Work

1. **Reference PRDs**: RFCs implement requirements defined in PRDs
2. **Define Architecture**: RFCs specify module design, interfaces, and data flow
3. **Guide Implementation**: Developers use RFCs as blueprints for code changes
4. **Document Decisions**: RFCs capture design rationale and alternatives considered
