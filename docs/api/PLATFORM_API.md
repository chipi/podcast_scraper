# Consumer Platform API (`/api/app`)

The end-user **Learning Platform** API — a slug-addressed, consumer-shaped surface that lets
a signed-in listener browse episodes, follow the synced transcript, play audio **streamed
from the original host**, search grounded passages, and keep a personal library / queue /
resume position. It is **separate from the operator API** (`/api/corpus/*`, `/api/relational/*`,
the GI/KG viewer) — different audience, its own auth, its own namespace.

- **Specs:** PRD-035–041, RFC-098 (foundation), RFC-100 (audio bridge), RFC-101 (corpus).
- **Mounted unconditionally** under `/api/app` by `create_app` (the legacy `enable_platform`
  flag is a no-op).
- **Decisions baked in:** shared corpus + per-user overlay · bridge-never-rehost · **no
  request-time LLM** (answers are extractive grounded retrieval) · per-user state as **plain
  files, no DB** · minimal OAuth multi-user.

---

## Auth & sessions

OAuth (single provider, Google to start) → a stateless **HMAC-signed session cookie**
(`lp_session`); no server-side session store. Per-user state lives under
`<APP_DATA_DIR>/users/<user_id>/` as plain JSON files.

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/app/auth/login` | Begin OAuth — **307** to the provider with a signed CSRF `state` cookie. **503** when unconfigured. |
| GET | `/api/app/auth/callback?code=&state=` | Verify state, exchange code, upsert user, set session, **307** to `/`. **400** bad state · **403** not on the allowlist · **502** exchange failure. |
| POST | `/api/app/auth/logout` | Clear the session cookie (**204**). |
| GET | `/api/app/me` | `{user_id, email, name}` for the signed-in user; **401** otherwise. |

**`get_current_user`** is the FastAPI dependency gating every per-user route: it resolves the
signed cookie → `User`, rejecting missing/forged/expired cookies **and disabled users** with
**401**.

### Access control (allowlist)

Default **deny**: only allow-listed emails/domains may create an account.

| Env | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `APP_SIGNUP_MODE` | `allowlist` (default) or `open`. |
| `APP_ALLOWED_EMAILS` | Comma-separated emails (allowlist mode). |
| `APP_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` | Comma-separated domains (allowlist mode). |

> With `allowlist` mode and an empty list, **nobody** can sign in until you add emails/domains
> (or set `APP_SIGNUP_MODE=open`).

### Access boundary

**Read** routes (episode detail/segments/insights/entities, search) are currently **open**
(anonymous read — RFC-098 OQ1, pending a decision). **Per-user state** routes
(playback/queue/library) and `me` require a session.

---

## Catalog (episode lists)

Episode lists are served through a pluggable **`ContentSource`** (`#1078`). The MVP backend
(`LocalCorpusSource`) enumerates the already-processed local corpus, newest-first; a
`DiscoverySource` (`#1069`) can later implement the same contract with no API change.
Lightweight by design — per-artifact depth counts (`insight_count`, `speaker_count`) are read
lazily from the per-episode endpoints, not the list.

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/app/episodes?page=&page_size=&status=&feed_id=` | Catalog across the corpus, newest-first. `{items[{slug, title, feed_id, podcast_title, publish_date, duration_seconds, episode_image_url, feed_image_url, artwork_url, status, summary_preview, summary_bullets[], topics[], has_transcript, has_summary, has_gi, has_kg, has_bridge}], page, page_size, total, has_more}`. `summary_preview` = short clean lede; `summary_bullets[]` = full summary (card expand-on-demand). `page≥1`, `1≤page_size≤100` (**422** otherwise). `status` ∈ `ready`\|`pending`. |
| GET | `/api/app/podcasts/{feed_id}/episodes?page=&page_size=&status=` | Same shape, scoped to one feed. |
| GET | `/api/app/podcasts` | Distinct shows in the corpus (Home "Your shows" + show-page header): `{items[{feed_id, title, artwork_url, image_url, description, episode_count}]}`. |

`status`: `ready` when a transcript exists (playable), else `pending`. Local-content MVP yields
`ready`; richer states (not-scraped/processing) arrive with scrape-on-demand (`#1069`).

---

## Episodes

Addressed by a stable, URL-safe **slug** (`{feed-slug}-{hash(feed_id,episode_id)}`), derived
deterministically and stable across re-scrapes.

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/app/episodes/{slug}` | Detail: `{slug, title, feed_id, podcast_title, publish_date, duration_seconds, episode_image_url, feed_image_url, summary_title, summary_bullets, summary_text, has_transcript, has_summary, has_gi, has_kg, has_bridge}`. **404** unknown slug. |
| GET | `/api/app/episodes/{slug}/segments` | The frozen `segments.json` contract: `{version, episode_slug, segments[{id, start, end, text, speaker?}]}`. **404** when no transcript/segments. |
| GET | `/api/app/episodes/{slug}/insights` | Grounded GIL insights: `{episode_slug, insights[{id, text, grounded, insight_type?, confidence?, position_hint?, quotes[{text, speaker?, char_start?, char_end?, start_ms?, end_ms?}]}]}`. Empty list when no GI. |
| GET | `/api/app/episodes/{slug}/entities` | KG entities: `{episode_slug, persons[], orgs[], topics[]}`. Empty when no KG. |
| GET | `/api/app/episodes/{slug}/related?top_k=` | "More like this" — semantic peer episodes (vector similarity), as an `AppEpisodesResponse`. **200 + empty** when the index is unavailable (graceful). |
| GET | `/api/app/episodes/{slug}/stats` | **Public** (no auth) cross-user reach — anonymous aggregate counts only: `{slug, listeners, opens, insights, daily[{date, count}]}` (`EpisodeStatsResponse`). Distinct listeners + total opens come from scanning every user's listen log; `insights` is the grounded-insight count; `daily` is a 14-day opens sparkline. Zeroed when no `APP_DATA_DIR` is configured. |

---

## Search (extractive grounded retrieval — no request-time LLM)

Reuses the hybrid index (RFC-090); answers are real ranked passages, never generated prose.

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/app/episodes/{slug}/search?q=&top_k=` | Episode-scoped: over-fetch by feed, narrow to this episode. |
| GET | `/api/app/search?q=&top_k=&grounded_only=&scope=` | Library-wide grounded search. `scope=all` (default) spans the shared corpus; **`scope=mine`** (P3 #1120, auth-gated — **401** signed out) is grounded **recall** over the user's heard∪captured set, with honest zero-coverage (empty, no global fallback). Each hit's `metadata` is enriched with `episode_slug` / `episode_title` / `podcast_title` / `episode_artwork` (thumb) so the client can jump to the episode + moment (`/episode/{slug}?t=`) and render results like library cards. |

Both return the standard search shape (`{query, results[{doc_id, score, metadata, text,
source_tier, supporting_quotes?, lifted?}], query_type, lift_stats?}`) and carry
`error:"no_index"` (HTTP 200, empty results) when no index is built.

---

## Artwork (serve our stored copy, never re-fetch from origin)

The counterpart to _bridge-never-rehost_ for audio: cover art is small and downloaded **once
at ingest** into the corpus-art store, so the app serves **our copy** and never re-fetches
graphics from the origin host. Two sizes, both derived from the local original (downscale
only): `large` (the original — ≥1400² at source, fits the player hero) and `thumb` (≤320px
for lists, generated on first request and cached). Content-addressed → served `immutable`,
so the browser + PWA service worker keep it on-device after one fetch.

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/app/artwork?ref=&size=` | Serve stored art. `ref` = corpus-relative path under the corpus-art store (**400** otherwise); `size` ∈ `large`\|`thumb` (default `large`). **404** when the file is absent. `Cache-Control: immutable`. |

Episode summary/detail carry **`artwork_url`** (our local copy — `thumb` in lists, `large`
in detail) plus the remote `episode_image_url`/`feed_image_url` as **fallback only**. Clients
use `artwork_url` when present.

---

## Audio bridge (play from origin, never rehost)

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/app/episodes/{slug}/audio-source?validate=` | `{episode_slug, url, mime?, duration_seconds?, media_id?, strategy:"direct", resolved_url?, verified?, content_length?}` from `content.media_url`. The client plays `url` directly. With `validate=true`, a HEAD follows redirects and reports `resolved_url`/`verified`/`content_length` (falls back to `verified:false` + the original URL on failure). **404** when no origin URL. |

> The server never stores or proxies third-party audio. A no-store pass-through proxy
> (for hosts that block direct play) is a documented, deferred follow-up.

---

## Per-user state (auth required; plain files, no DB)

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/app/playback` | All saved positions, newest-updated first (Home "Continue"): `{items[{slug, position_seconds, updated_at?}]}`. |
| GET, PUT | `/api/app/playback/{slug}` | Resume position `{slug, position_seconds, updated_at?}`; GET returns 0 when unset. |
| GET, PUT | `/api/app/queue` | Play queue `{items: [slug, …]}`. |
| GET, POST, DELETE | `/api/app/library` (+ `/{feed_id}`) | Subscriptions — list / subscribe (idempotent on `feed_id`) / unsubscribe. |

### Favorites & interests

The favorites bucket is **polymorphic** (episodes + insights, grouped by kind). Interests are a
**mixed token set** — clusters (`tc:`), topics (`topic:`) and people (`person:`) — fed by two
entry-points: the Home cluster picker (writes `tc:` ids via `PUT`) and the `Follow` toggle on a
person/topic entity card (single-token `POST` / `DELETE`). They drive flag-gated personalized
discovery (`rank_discover`, which scores cluster + topic + person overlap; see PRD-043 / RFC-102).

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/app/favorites` | Saved items grouped by kind: `{episodes[{…EpisodeSummary}], insights[{ref, text, episode_slug?, podcast_title?, start_ms?}]}` (`AppFavoritesResponse`). Episodes are hydrated from the corpus; insights are a stored snapshot (no global detail route). |
| PUT | `/api/app/favorites` | Save an item (idempotent on `kind`+`ref`); body `{kind: episode\|insight\|person\|topic, ref, label?, sublabel?, slug?, start_ms?}` (`FavoriteAdd`). Returns the updated favorites. |
| DELETE | `/api/app/favorites/{kind}/{ref}` | Remove a saved item by `kind`+`ref` (`ref` URL-encoded; no-op if absent). Returns the updated favorites. |
| GET, PUT | `/api/app/interests` | The user's interest token list `{items: [token, …]}` (`InterestsResponse`); `PUT` replaces it `{items}` (`InterestsUpdate`). Tokens are a mixed set (`tc:` / `topic:` / `person:`). |
| POST | `/api/app/interests/{token}` | Follow one token (cluster `tc:` / topic `topic:` / person `person:`), idempotent; returns `{items[]}`. |
| DELETE | `/api/app/interests/{token}` | Unfollow one token (no-op if absent); returns `{items[]}`. |
| GET | `/api/app/clusters?limit=` | **Top interest clusters** for the picker, by corpus prevalence: `{items[{id, label, size}]}` (`AppInterestClustersResponse`). `1≤limit≤50` (default 12). |

### Listening analytics

Computed from per-user files (playback + an append-only listen-events log) — **no DB, no LLM**.
`/me/stats` is the signed-in user's own summary; `/episodes/{slug}/stats` (in **Episodes** above) is
the **public + anonymous** cross-user reach.

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/app/listen/{slug}` | Append one "episode opened" event to the user's listen log (`<data_dir>/users/<id>/listen_events.jsonl`) for analytics. **204**; best-effort, never blocks playback. |
| GET | `/api/app/me/stats` | The signed-in user's own listening summary: `{episodes, shows, listening_seconds, active_days, day_streak, daily[{date, count}]}` (`UserStatsResponse`). `daily` is a 14-day opens sparkline; `StatPoint` = `{date, count}`. |

---

## Knowledge cards (person / topic)

KG-grounded person/topic cards (PRD-043; RFC-102). `scope=mine` (P3 #1122, auth-gated — **401**
signed out) is the **"your corpus" lens**: the guest/topic restricted to the episodes the user has
heard∪captured (the _appears-in_ list + `episode_count` are filtered).

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/app/persons/{id}?scope=` | Person card `{id, label, episode_count, episodes[…Summary], related_people[], related_topics[]}` (`AppPersonCard`); **404** when the person is in no KG. |
| GET | `/api/app/topics/{id}?scope=` | Topic card `{id, label, cluster_*, sibling_topics[], episode_count, episodes[…], related_people[]}` (`AppTopicCard`); **404** when absent. |
| GET | `/api/app/entities/search?q=` | Resolve a query to a person/topic card (exact/near-exact); `{query, entity}` or `entity:null`. |

---

## Capture — highlights & notes (P2; PRD-040 / RFC-098 §7)

Per-user files (`highlights.json`, `notes.json`); all **auth-gated** (**401** signed out). The route
mints opaque ids + timestamps; the timestamp is the stable anchor (re-anchors on re-scrape, never
dropped).

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/app/highlights?episode=` | The user's highlights (`{items[Highlight]}`), optionally scoped to one episode slug. `Highlight` = `{id, episode_slug, kind(span\|moment\|insight), start_ms?, end_ms?, char_start?, char_end?, segment_ids[], quote_text?, speaker?, source_insight_id?, color?, created_at, anchor_status?}`. |
| POST | `/api/app/highlights` | Capture a highlight (**201**); body `HighlightCreate`. |
| PATCH | `/api/app/highlights/{id}` | Edit `color` / `quote_text` (`exclude_unset` — explicit `color:null` clears it); **404** if absent. |
| DELETE | `/api/app/highlights/{id}` | Remove; returns the remaining `{items[]}`. |
| GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE | `/api/app/notes` (+ `/{id}`) | Free-text notes targeting `highlight\|insight\|episode`. `GET ?target=&target_id=` scopes; `POST` (**201**) `{target, target_id, text}` (`text` min length 1 → **422**); `PATCH {text}`; `DELETE`. |
| GET | `/api/app/highlights/export.md` | Markdown export of all highlights + attached notes (grouped by episode; `text/markdown` attachment). |

---

## Consolidation — recall, enrichment, resurfacing (P3; PRD-041 / RFC-101)

Read-time projections over the user's heard∪captured corpus + the RFC-088 enrichment envelopes — **no
request-time LLM (D6)**, **read-only over enrichments (ADR-104)**. The heard set = ≥30% played ∪ any
capture (RFC-101 §1).

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/app/episodes/{slug}/enrichment` | Per-episode enrichment signals `{slug, signals{<enricher_id>: data}}` for the viewed episode (RFC-088 envelopes; only OK enrichers). **404** unknown slug. |
| GET | `/api/app/corpus/enrichment` | Corpus-scope signals `{signals{<enricher_id>: data}}` (temporal velocity, topic similarity, …). |
| GET | `/api/app/resurfacing` | Highlights due to resurface, most-overdue first: `{items[{highlight, reflection_prompt}], paused}`. Read-time ladder (2d/1w/1mo/3mo on `created_at`/`last_surfaced`); empty when paused. **Auth-gated.** |
| POST | `/api/app/resurfacing/{id}/surfaced` | Record a resurfaced highlight as seen (advances its ladder). **204.** |
| GET, PUT | `/api/app/resurfacing/settings` | Pacing `{paused}` (`PUT` to pause/resume). |
| GET | `/api/app/interests/derived` | Implicit interests ranked by occurrence across the user's corpus: `{items[{token, kind, label, count}]}` — `person:`/`topic:` tokens, beside explicit follows. **Auth-gated.** |

> Recall itself is `GET /api/app/search?scope=mine` (see **Search**) — grounded retrieval over the
> heard set, not a separate endpoint.

---

## Operator API — admin-only (separate surface)

The operator API backs the viewer's **admin-only** surfaces (Dashboard, Ops, Configuration). It
covers `/api/feeds`, `/api/operator-config`, `/api/ops`, `/api/jobs*`, `/api/scheduled-jobs`,
`/api/enrichment/config`, `/api/index/rebuild` — **reads and writes** (#1071, admin gating #1128):

- **Access rule:** a request is allowed with a valid **admin session** (the shared `lp_session`
  cookie → `role == admin`) **OR** a valid operator **key** (`X-Operator-Key` matching
  `APP_OPERATOR_API_KEY`). Otherwise **403**. Either credential grants access — browser admins use
  their session; headless automation can use the key.
- **Enforced only when it can be:** the gate activates when platform auth is configured (a session
  secret + per-user data dir) **or** a key is set. A bare deployment with neither keeps the prior
  network-only (Tailscale, RFC-082) behavior — no lockout on upgrade.
- Every mutating operator request is appended to `<APP_DATA_DIR>/audit.jsonl` (best-effort).
- Roles: `listener` (player only) < `creator` (viewer base) < `admin` (+ Dashboard/Ops/Config/users).
  Bootstrap admins via `APP_ADMIN_EMAILS`.

---

## Configuration (env)

| Env | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `APP_DATA_DIR` | `<corpus>/.app` | Per-user files + audit log (outside the shared corpus tree). |
| `APP_SESSION_SECRET` | _(unset → auth inert)_ | HMAC key for the session cookie. |
| `APP_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` | `false` | Set `true` behind HTTPS. |
| `APP_OAUTH_PROVIDER` | _(unset → Google)_ | Set `mock` to use the local network-free provider for **dev/e2e only** (never prod); logged loudly. |
| `APP_OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `_SECRET` | _(unset → login 503)_ | Google OAuth app credentials. |
| `APP_OAUTH_MOCK_EMAIL` / `_SUBJECT` / `_NAME` | `dev@localhost` / `dev-local` / `Dev User` | Override the mock provider's dev identity (only when `APP_OAUTH_PROVIDER=mock`). |
| `APP_SIGNUP_MODE` / `APP_ALLOWED_EMAILS` / `APP_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` | `allowlist` / — / — | Access control. |
| `APP_ADMIN_EMAILS` | _(unset → no bootstrap admins)_ | CSV of emails granted `admin` on login. |
| `APP_OPERATOR_API_KEY` | _(unset)_ | Operator API key — an alternative to an admin session for the admin-only operator routes. |

---

## Tooling

- **Reference client** — `python -m podcast_scraper.server.app_reference_client --base-url
  <url> --session <lp_session cookie> --slug <slug>` walks the whole spine end-to-end (a
  contract proof; the product PWA is RFC-099).
- **Operator user admin** — `python -m podcast_scraper.server.app_users_cli
  {list,disable,enable,delete,export} --data-dir <APP_DATA_DIR>`.

## Not yet (deferred)

- **Consumer scrape-on-demand** (`POST /api/app/scrape`, #1069 **phase 2**) — deferred to the
  self-serve epic (Podcast Index `DiscoverySource` + guardrails), gated on real persistence + the
  PWA. The operator-side ingestion primitive already exists (`podcast_scraper ingest`, single-feed
  pipeline over #807), so curated corpus growth is available today. See
  `docs/wip/player/1069-SCRAPE-ON-DEMAND-SCOPE-ANALYSIS.md`.
- **No-store audio proxy** (#1070) — until a host blocks direct play.
- **Consumer PWA** (RFC-099) — the actual front-end app, a separate workstream.

See the per-route detail in [HTTP_API.md](HTTP_API.md).
