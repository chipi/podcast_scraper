## ⚠️ PRIMARY REFERENCE FILES ⚠️

**For Cursor AI (automatic enforcement):**
**`.cursorrules`** - Critical rules enforced automatically by Cursor

**For all AI assistants (comprehensive guidelines):**
**`.ai-coding-guidelines.md`** - Complete AI coding guidelines (PRIMARY source of truth)

## 🚨 START-OF-SESSION CHECKLIST (MANDATORY - DO THIS FIRST)

**Before taking ANY action in this project, you MUST:**

1. ✅ **Read `.cursorrules`** (for Cursor AI) or **`.ai-coding-guidelines.md`** (for other AI)
2. ✅ **Acknowledge you've read it** - Say "I've read the AI guidelines" or similar
3. ✅ **Confirm you understand** - The user may ask "Did you read the guidelines?" - Answer honestly
4. ✅ **Reference the guidelines** for all decisions about commits, pushes, and workflows

**If the user asks "Did you read the guidelines?" or "Check the guidelines first":**

- ✅ **STOP what you're doing**
- ✅ **Read `.cursorrules` or `.ai-coding-guidelines.md` immediately**
- ✅ **Acknowledge what you read**
- ✅ **Then proceed with the task**

## Quick Reference

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- ❌ NEVER push any branch without explicit user approval (commits OK after diff approval, pushes NEVER by default)
- ❌ NEVER commit without showing changes and getting user approval
- ❌ NEVER push to main branch (always use feature branches)
- ✅ Always show `git status` and `git diff` before committing
- ✅ Always wait for explicit user approval before committing
- ✅ Always run `make ci-fast` before committing
- ✅ ALWAYS use Makefile commands (never direct pytest/python/black commands)
- ✅ NEVER use `cd` to project root (already in workspace directory)
- ✅ ALWAYS use correct GitHub username (check dynamically, not Mac username)
- ✅ ALWAYS show terminal output for make/test commands (`is_background: false`)
- ✅ Run `make fix-md` immediately after ANY markdown edit (zero lint violations before review)

## 📚 COMPLETE GUIDE FILE SET (LOAD ALL WHEN REQUESTED)

**When the user asks to "load ai coding guidelines" or "load coding guidelines", you MUST load ALL of these files:**

1. ✅ **`.ai-coding-guidelines.md`** - Main AI coding guidelines (PRIMARY source of truth)
2. ✅ **`docs/guides/CURSOR_AI_BEST_PRACTICES_GUIDE.md`** - Cursor AI best practices and model selection
3. ✅ **`docs/guides/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`** - Detailed development guide (code style, testing, CI/CD, architecture)
4. ✅ **`docs/guides/TESTING_GUIDE.md`** - Testing guide (unit, integration, E2E implementation)
5. ✅ **`docs/guides/MARKDOWN_LINTING_GUIDE.md`** - Markdown style and linting guide (style rules,
   linting practices, tools, workflows)

**Why load all of them:**

- `.ai-coding-guidelines.md` provides critical workflow rules
- `CURSOR_AI_BEST_PRACTICES_GUIDE.md` provides model selection and workflow optimization
- `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` provides detailed technical patterns and implementation details
- `TESTING_GUIDE.md` provides comprehensive testing implementation details
- `MARKDOWN_LINTING_GUIDE.md` provides markdown style rules and linting standards

**Loading pattern:**

```python

# When user says "load ai coding guidelines" or "load coding guidelines":
