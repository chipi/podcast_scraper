# AI Coding Guidelines for podcast_scraper

## ⚠️ PRIMARY REFERENCE FILES ⚠️

**For Cursor AI (automatic enforcement):**
**`.cursorrules`** - Critical rules enforced automatically by Cursor

**For all AI assistants (comprehensive guidelines):**
**`.ai-coding-guidelines.md`** - Complete AI coding guidelines (PRIMARY source of truth)

## Quick Reference

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- ❌ NEVER push any branch without explicit user approval (commits OK after diff approval, pushes NEVER by default)
- ❌ NEVER commit without showing changes and getting user approval
- ❌ NEVER push to main branch (always use feature branches)
- ✅ Always show `git status` and `git diff` before committing
- ✅ Always wait for explicit user approval before committing
- ✅ After making file edits: summarize changes and ask "Keep these changes or undo any of them?"
- ✅ When intent is clear: **run commands and tools yourself** (make, scripts, tests); **only** ask when blocked (auth/secrets, ambiguous scope, or policy needs approval) — see *Autonomous execution* in `.cursorrules` / `.ai-coding-guidelines.md`
- ✅ When any make target fails (test, ci, lint, format, docs, etc.): establish root cause first, then fix from there (no random experimenting)
- ✅ Always run `make ci-fast` before committing (exception: workflow-only changes — only `.github/workflows/*.yml` modified; nothing to validate locally)
- ✅ ALWAYS use Makefile commands (never direct pytest/python/black commands)
- ✅ NEVER use `cd` to project root (already in workspace directory)
- ✅ ALWAYS use correct GitHub username (check with `mcp_github_get_me`, not Mac username)
- ✅ ALWAYS show terminal output for make/test commands (`is_background: false`)
- ✅ Run `make fix-md` immediately after ANY markdown edit (zero lint violations before review)
